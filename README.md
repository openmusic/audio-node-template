# openmusic-audio-node-template

> Template for building audio nodes

## Usage

Clone the repository, and then copy the files to your own folder.

Install build dependencies, etc:

```bash
npm install
```

To build a bundle for the demo:

```bash
npm run build
```

Demo files will be placed in `build/`.

Remember to rebuild the bundle each time you make a change to the demo or node code. Alternatively you can also run the watch task, so it will watch for file changes and then rebuild the bundle for you:

```bash
npm run watch
```
